"code view" - a GUI pane displaying expressions in a programming language (includes stage and result)
"stage" - the code view which contains the code currently being edited, as opposed to the execution result or other UI features
"syntree" - a tree representing code; a syntax tree (~ AST)
"tree" - the data structure being edited (adopt this b/c the editor doesn't just edit code?)
"syno" - a syntactical node, i.e. a node in a abstract syntax tree
"presentation" - a tree representing information about code which is to be displayed to the user
"presno" - a node in the presentation; something which can be focused on in the presentation
"navigation" - action taken by the user to moved their view through the syntree, i.e., changing the current focused syno
  * out - moving towards ancestors
  * in - moving towards decendants
  * prev - moving to the previous ordered sibling
  * next - moving to the next ordered sibling
"scion" - a syno or syntree without a parent (analogy from horticultural grafting)
"stock"/"rootstock" -  a syno onto which a scion is grafted

Project Name
  * the visual form of a syno, the colored wurst-shaped things, should be named after twisting balloons (like the ones clowns make balloon animals out of). So the project name should be related?
    * "twist" variant
      * "twistage" lol (Perceptive has phased out the name, but IP... email Dave?)
      * "twister", but shouldn't that be the name for a user? tornados -> mixed metaphor?
    * there's "model", a word also user by balloon twister/balloon modeler
      * not great ratio between innate attractiveness and potential confusion with other software terms
    * "balloon knot"
      * just kidding
    * something related to knot theory?
      * "unknot", since twist balloons all technically unknots in that they can be tied (?)
        * plus progressive connotation of "unknotting" code
    * clown stuff
      * "clown gloves", but come on
      * using this one for now to force myself to replace it later
    * "tie" or "ty", etc.
      * if "tier" is the user...
    * "knotworks"
  * things unrelated to balloon twisting
    * go with pill analogy
      * "pill"
      * "capsule"
        * "encapsulate"--nice but probably best to steer clear of encapsulation, right?
      * "gelcap"
    * the idea of "directly seeing" "the data itself", directly seeing the structure
      * structure/shape/form
    * jelly beans or gummies?
    * snakes inside snakes?
