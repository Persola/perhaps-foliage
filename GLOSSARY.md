"code view" - a GUI pane displaying expressions in a programming language
"stage" - the code view which contains the code currently being edited, as opposed to the execution result or other UI features
"syntree" - a tree representing code; a syntax tree (~ AST)
"syno" - a syntactical node, i.e. a node in a syntree
"presentation" - a tree representing information about code which is to be displayed to the user
"presno" - a node in the presentation
"navigation" - action taken by the user to moved their view through the syntree, i.e., changing the current focused syno
  * out - moving towards ancestors
  * in - moving towards decendants
  * prev - moving to the previous ordered sibling
  * next - moving to the next ordered sibling
"scion" - a syno or syntree without a parent (analogy from horticultural grafting)
"stock"/"rootstock" -  a syno onto which a scion is grafted

note: the visual units which correlate to synos, the colored wurst-shaped things, should be named after twisting balloons (like the ones clowns make balloon animals out of). This is a powerful enough visual metaphor that it might be worth naming the editor after...
  there are already things named "twist", but maybe:
    * "twist" variant
      * "twistage" lol (Perceptive has phased out the name, but IP... email Dave?)
      * "twister", but shouldn't that be the name for a user? tornados -> mixed metaphor?
    * there's "model", a word also user by balloon twister/balloon modeler
      * not great ratio between innate attractiveness and potential confusion with other software terms
    * something related to knot theory?
      * "unknot", since twist balloons all technically unknots in that they can be tied (?)
        * plus progressive connotation of "unknotting" code
    * clown stuff
      * "clown gloves", but come on
    * things unrelated to balloon twisting
      * go with pill analogy
        * "pill"
        * "capsule"
          * "encapsulate"--nice but probably best to steer clear of encapsulation, right?
        * "gelcap"
      * the idea of "directly seeing" "the data itself"
        * ? "true sight"
      * jelly beans or gummies?
      * snakes inside snakes?
