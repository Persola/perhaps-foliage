「**code view**」 a GUI pane displaying expressions in a programming language. The editor has one for editing (`stage`) and one for displaying interpretation results (`result`) that come back from the Saliva interpreter

「**syntree** || **tree**」 an AST or other data tree, usually the thing being edited

「**syno**」 - a node in a syntree

「**presentation**」 a data tree representing what information from the syntree being edited *is being presented to the user* at a given moment

「**presno**」 a node in the presentation; something which can be focused on in the presentation. There is a presno for each syno presented (not all synos are presented), but some presnos have no syno (they are visual extensions from a presno that does have a syno).

「**focus**」 Much like focus in a text document, the singular part of the document the user is "in" a the moment. Can be a syno, presno (atttached to a syno), or text character index (attached to a presno attached to a syno).

「**navigate**」 moving the focus through the presentation

not really used yet:
「*scion*」 a syno or syntree without a parent (analogy from horticultural grafting)
「*stock*/*rootstock*」 a syno onto which a scion is grafted

**Notes on the project name**
  * the visual form of a syno, the colored wurst-shaped things, should be named after twisting balloons (like the ones clowns make balloon animals out of). So the project name should be related?
    * "twist" variant
      * "twistage" lol (Perceptive has phased out the name, but IP... email Dave?)
    * "twister", but shouldn't that be the name for a user? tornados -> mixed metaphor?
    * there's "model", a word also user by balloon twister/balloon modeler
      * not great ratio between innate attractiveness and potential confusion with other software terms
    * something related to knot theory?
      * "unknot", since twist balloons all technically unknots in that they can be tied (?)
      * plus progressive connotation of "unknotting" code
    * "tie" or "ty", etc.
      * if "tier" is the user...
    * "knotworks"
  * things unrelated to balloon twisting
    * go with pill analogy
      * "pill"
      * "capsule"
        * "encapsulate"--nice but probably best to steer clear of encapsulation, right?
      * "gelcap"
    * the idea of "directly seeing" "the data itself", directly seeing the structure
      * structure/shape/form
      * x-ray/ultraviolet/blacklight/
      * the idea of removing an intermediary
        * 'scales fell from eyes' is inadequate, but something like that
        * myth or story trickster figure whose trick is mucking around as an intermediary?
    * jelly beans or gummies?
    * colorful trees
      * Eucalyptus deglupta
      * chlorophyll/autumn/**foliage**
    * primates
      * a trichromat?
      * a brachiator? (gibbons, siamangs)
