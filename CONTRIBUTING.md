#### Development setup

First, see how to build and run the builds in README.md

##### A note on VSCode

This project includes a VSCode extension. VSCode includes some features that make it easier to develop VSCode extensions within VSCode itself. For this reason, it's generally assumed the project will be developed using VSCode, at least as a text editor and for debugging in some cases. If you use another editor, you may need to set up some parts of the development environment for yourself.

A `.code-workspace` file is provided at the top level. It's a multi-root workspace, with one directory at the top level to include everything and one directory for each project, so VSCode will recognize configuration per project. This is necessary, for example, for launching VSCode debuggers. (Perhaps some problem could be caused by having a multi-root workspace in which some of the directories are ancestors of others?)

##### Debugging

Background info
[debugging node](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/)
[remote-redux-devtools](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/remote-redux-devtools)

* web
  * the main process (renderer context): use your browser's dev tools in the window where the app is running
  * the web worker (core context): use your browser's web worker debug method
    * Firefox: [this firefox](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox) -> `Shared Workers`
      * not sure how to set break points in the code of a newly instantiated shared worker (to inspect app initialization)
* electron
  * [the main process (core context)](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/debugging-main-process)
    * in vscode debugger, launch `main proc. electron` (a launch.json is provided)
  * the renderer process (renderer context): use dev tools built into electron window
* vscode extensions
  * the main process (core context)
    * in vscode debugger, launch `vscode-saliva extension` (a launch.json is provided)
  * the renderer process (renderer context)
    * use the dev tools in the VSCode instance running the extension (Developer: Toggle Developer Tools)
      * source maps don't work due to [a bug](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/145184)
      * but you can use the built version: top -> some random string -> pending-frame (index.html) -> file+vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net -> full filesystem path

To use redux dev tools with any of the builds:
* install the vscode extension [Redux DevTools for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jingkaizhao.vscode-redux-devtools)
* run the vscode command 'run devtools to the side' to open it
* configure it
  * fix "localhost" misspelling
  * enter port 8001
    * this correlates to port hardcoded in create-editor-state-store.js
    * and to the port in start-rdt-server.js
  * `npm run rdt` (keep it running while you use it)
  * start the app of the chosen build


##### Known Errors

```shell
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'bufferutil' in '[...]/shared/node_modules/ws/lib'
```
and
```shell
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'utf-8-validate' in '[...]/shared/node_modules/ws/lib'
```

See [thread](https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/1220). You can ignore them.
